### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

### **<br/>What is simulation?**

A simulation is the imitation (নকল করা) of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.<br/>Simulation is a powerful tool that can be used to model real-world processes or systems.<br/>

### **<be/>Why simulation is required?**
  - Simulation simplifies complex systems for easier analysis.
  - It reduces real-world experimentation costs.
  - It can assess and mitigate risks before making critical decisions.
  - It Predicts future events accurately.
  - It explores rare or extreme scenarios.
  - Simulation produces a data set to estimate the performance of a system.


### **<br/>When Simulation is the Appropiate Tool.**
  - Study and experiment with the internal interactions of a complex system.
  - Informational, organizational, and environmental changes can be simulated, and the model’s behavior can be observed.
  - The knowledge gained in designing a simulation model can be valuable in suggesting improvements in the system under investigation.
  - By changing simulation inputs and observing the resulting outputs, valuable insight may be obtained into which variables are most important and how variables interact.
  - Simulation can be a pedagogical (teaching) device to reinforce analytic solution methodologies.
  - It can be used to experiment with new designs or policies before implementation.
  - It can be used to verify analytic solutions.
  - By simulating different capabilities for a machine, requirements can be determined.
  - Simulation models designed for training, allow learning without the cost and disruption of on-the-job instructions.
  - It shows an animation system in simulated operation to visualize the plan.
  - The modern system is so complex that its internal interaction can be treated only by simulation.


### **<br/>Discuss the situation when the simulation is not an appropriate tool.**
  - If the problem can be solved using common sense.
  - When the problem can be solved analytically(logically).
  - If it is easier to perform direct experiments.
  - If the cost exceeds savings.
  - If resources or time are not available.
  - If system behavior is too complex.


### **<br/>Advantage of Simulation**
  - New policies, operating procedures, decision rules, information flows, and organizational procedures can be explored without disrupting the real system's ongoing operations.
  - New hardware designs, physical layouts, transportation systems, etc can be tested without committing resources to their acquisition.
  - Hypotheses about how or why certain phenomena occur can be tested for feasibility.
  - Time can be compressed or expanded allowing for a speedup or slowdown of the phenomena under investigation.
  -  Insight can be obtained about the interaction of variables.
  -  Insight can be obtained about the importance of variables to the system's performance.


### **<br/>Disadvantage of Simulation**
  - Model building requires special training.
  - Simulation results can be difficult to interpret.
  - Simulation modeling and analysis can be time-consuming and expensive.
  - Simulation is sometimes used when an analytical solution is possible or even preferable.

  ### **<br/>What are the different components of a system? Explain each of them.**
  A system is defined as a group of objects that are joined together in some regular interaction or interdependence to accomplish some purpose.<br/>
  The different components of a system are:<br/>
    - Entity: An object of interest in the system, such as machines in the factory.
    - Attribute: The property of an entity. Such as speed, capacity, etc.
    - Activity: A period of specified length. Such as welding, stamping, etc.
    - State: A collection of variables that describe the system at any time. Such as the status of machines (busy, idle, down, etc).
    - Event: An instantaneous occurrence that might change the state of the system. Example: breakdown.
    - Endogenous: Activities and events occurring within the system.
    - Exogenous:  Activities and events occurring within the environment.
