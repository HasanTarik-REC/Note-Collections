  - Product Quality
  - Risk Assessment

  - Customer Communication
  - Staffing
  - Other Resources
  - Project Monitoring

### **<br/>Why Project Fail?**
  - Changing customer requirement
  - Ambiguous/Incomplete requirement
  - Unrealistic deadline
  - An honest underestimate of effort
  - Predictable or unpredictable risks
  - Technical difficulties
  - Miscommunication among project staff

### **<br/>Management Spectrum**
Effective project management focuses on four aspects of the project known as the 4 P’s:<br/>
  - People - The most important element of a successful project. (recruiting, selection, performance management, training, compensation, career development, organization, work design, team/culture development)
  - Product - The software to be built (product objectives, scope, alternative solutions, constraint)
  - Process - The set of framework activities and software engineering tasks to get the job done (framework activities populated with tasks, milestones, work products, and QA points)
  - Project - All work required to make the product a reality. (planning, monitoring, controlling)<br/>
  
### **<br/>People**<br/>**Player of the project**
  - The Stakeholders
  - Team leaders
  - Agile Team (Implementer)
  - Coordination and Communication Issues.<br/>

### **<br/>Stakeholders**
  - Senior managers who define the business issues that often have a significant influence on the project.<br/>
  - Project (technical) managers must plan, motivate, organize, and control the practitioners who do software work.<br/>
  - Practitioners who deliver the technical skills necessary to engineer a product or application.
Customers who specify the requirements for the software to be engineered and other stakeholders who have a peripheral interest in the outcome.<br/>
  - End-users who interact with the software once it is released for production use.<br/>

### **<br/>Team Leaders**
`MOI model for leadership`<br/>
  - Motivation  The ability to encourage (by “push or pull”) technical people to produce to their best ability.<br/>
    - Organization The ability to mold existing processes (or invent new ones) that will enable the initial concept to be translated into a final product.<br/>
    - Ideas or Innovation.  The ability to encourage people to create and feel creative even when they must work within bounds established for a particular software product or application.<br/>
    - Characteristics of effective project managers (problem-solving, managerial identity, achievement, influence, and team building)<br/>
