  - Defining Requirements
  - Designing the Software
  - Building or Developing the Software
  - Testing the Software
  - Deployment and Maintenance


#### <br/>Planning & Requirement Analysis<br/>
Requirement analysis is the most fundamental stage in SDLC. The senior members of the team perform it with inputs from all the stakeholders and domain experts or SMEs in the industry.<br/> 
Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identifying the risks associated with the project is also done at this stage.<br/>

#### `Business Requirements`
Business requirements is a phase in the Software development life cycle that greets the requirements of the end users to guide the design of the future system.<br/>
Business requirements are usually captured by business analysts or product owners who analyze business activities or who have subject matter expertise (SMEs).<br/>

#### `Stakeholder Requirements`
Stakeholder requirements are the needs, expectations, and desires of individuals or groups who have an interest in a software project. They form the foundation for successful software development by ensuring that the final product meets the needs of its intended users and aligns with the goals of the organization.<br/>
Two types of stakeholders:<br/>
- `Internal stakeholders:` Employees, managers, and executives within the organization.
- `External stakeholders:` Customers, end-users, partners, regulators, and investors.
