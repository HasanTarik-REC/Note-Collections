### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

### **<br/>Define Software and Software Engineering.**
`Software:` Software is: (1) instructions (computer programs) that when executed, provide desired
features, function, and performance; (2) data structures that enable the programs to manipulate operations adequately and, (3) documents that describe the programs' operation and use.<br/>
Software products may be<br/>
   - Generic - developed for a general market e.g. PC software such as Excel or Word.
   - Bespoke (custom) - developed for a particular customer according to their specification.

   
   
`Software Engineering:` Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development, operation, and maintenance. It involves a disciplined approach to creating reliable, efficient, and maintainable software products.<br/>
#### Key activities in software engineering:<br/>
  - `Requirements gathering:` Understanding the needs of the users.
  - `Design:` Creating a blueprint of the software system.
  - `Coding:` Writing the actual code using programming languages.
  - `Testing:` Ensuring the software works as expected.
  - `Deployment:` Releasing the software to users.
  - `Maintenance:` Fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving performance.


### **<br/>Evolving Role of Software.**
Today, software takes on a dual role. It is a product, and at the same time, the vehicle for delivering a product.<br/>
As a product,<br/>
Transforms information such as produces, manages, acquires, modifies, displays, or transmits information.  And it delivers the computing potential of hardware and networks.<br/>
As the vehicle for delivering a product,<br/>
the software acts as the basis for the control of the computer (operating systems), the communication of information (networking software), and the creation and control of other programs (software tools and environments).<br/>
