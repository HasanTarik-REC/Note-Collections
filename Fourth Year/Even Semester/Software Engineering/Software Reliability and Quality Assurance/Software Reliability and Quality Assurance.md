### **<br/>What is software quality?**
Software quality refers to the characteristics of a software product that determine its ability to satisfy the stated needs of its users. In simpler terms, it refers to a software product that meets its intended purpose and user expectations.

### **<br/>Define Software Quality Assurance.**
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a systematic approach to ensuring software meets specified requirements and expectations. It encompasses a range of activities aimed at preventing defects and ensuring the quality of the software product throughout its lifecycle.<br/>

### **<br/>Write down the different roles of a SQA group.**
Roles of a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Group:<br/>
  - Test Planning
      - Define the objectives, scope, and approach of testing.
      - Create detailed test plans and strategies.
      - Identify testing tools, resources, and timelines.
 - Test Design and Development
      - Design test cases and test scripts based on functional and non-functional requirements.
      - Develop automated test scripts and frameworks (if applicable).
      - Identify and prepare test data for different scenarios.
 - Test Execution
     - Execute manual and automated test cases to verify the functionality of the software.  
     - Perform different types of testing such as unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
     - Log defects or issues found during testing and track them until resolution.
 - Process Monitoring and Improvement
     - Monitor the adherence of the development process to predefined standards and guidelines.
     - Conduct audits and reviews to ensure that the processes are being followed.
     - Suggest improvements to the software development process based on test results and quality metrics.
  - Risk Management
      - Identify potential risks related to software quality.
      - Develop risk mitigation strategies to address and minimize those risks.
      - Continuously assess risks throughout the software lifecycle.
  - Quality Metrics and Reporting:
      - Define and monitor quality metrics such as defect density, test coverage, and mean time to failure (MTTF).
      - Generate reports that provide insights into the quality of the software.
      - Present findings and recommendations to the management for decision-making.
