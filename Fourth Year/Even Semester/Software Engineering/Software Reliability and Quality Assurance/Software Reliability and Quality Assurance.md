### **<br/>What is software quality?**
Software quality refers to the characteristics of a software product that determine its ability to satisfy the stated needs of its users. In simpler terms, it refers to a software product that meets its intended purpose and user expectations.

### **<br/>Write the software quality management activities.**
Software Quality Management involves the systematic processes and activities that ensure the software product meets specified quality requirements and standards. SQM aims to enhance the software’s reliability, functionality, performance, and overall quality.<br/>
Here are the primary Software Quality Management activities:<br/>
  - `Quality Assurance:` Quality assurance focuses on setting up a systematic process to prevent defects and ensure high standards during software development. It is process-oriented.
  - `Quality Planning:` This is the activity of defining the quality standards and determining how they will be achieved for the software project.
  - `Quality Control:` Quality control focuses on identifying and fixing defects in the software product through inspection and testing. It is product-oriented.
  - `Test Management:` Test management involves planning, executing, and monitoring the testing activities in the project to ensure software quality.
  - `Metrics and Reporting:` Measuring and reporting on the software’s quality attributes, development processes, and testing outcomes is crucial for evaluating quality progress.
  - `Risk Management:` Risk management focuses on identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks that could impact software quality.
  - `Process Improvement:` Continuous process improvement aims to enhance the development and quality management processes for better efficiency and software quality.
  - ``Customer Feedback and Satisfaction:`` Gathering feedback from customers and users helps assess software quality and identify areas for improvement in future releases.

### **<br/>Define Software Quality Assurance.**
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a systematic approach to ensuring software meets specified requirements and expectations. It encompasses a range of activities aimed at preventing defects and ensuring the quality of the software product throughout its lifecycle.<br/>

### **<br/>Write down the different roles of a SQA group.**
Roles of a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Group:<br/>
  - Test Planning
      - Define the objectives, scope, and approach of testing.
      - Create detailed test plans and strategies.
      - Identify testing tools, resources, and timelines.
 - Test Design and Development
      - Design test cases and test scripts based on functional and non-functional requirements.
      - Develop automated test scripts and frameworks (if applicable).
      - Identify and prepare test data for different scenarios.
 - Test Execution
     - Execute manual and automated test cases to verify the functionality of the software.  
     - Perform different types of testing such as unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
     - Log defects or issues found during testing and track them until resolution.
 - Process Monitoring and Improvement
     - Monitor the adherence of the development process to predefined standards and guidelines.
     - Conduct audits and reviews to ensure that the processes are being followed.
     - Suggest improvements to the software development process based on test results and quality metrics.
  - Risk Management
      - Identify potential risks related to software quality.
      - Develop risk mitigation strategies to address and minimize those risks.
      - Continuously assess risks throughout the software lifecycle.
  - Quality Metrics and Reporting:
      - Define and monitor quality metrics such as defect density, test coverage, and mean time to failure (MTTF).
      - Generate reports that provide insights into the quality of the software.
      - Present findings and recommendations to the management for decision-making.


### **<br/>Define Software Risk**
Software risk refers to the potential for an undesirable outcome in a software project, which may impact its success in terms of quality, schedule, budget, or performance.<br/> It arises from uncertainties in the development process and can be caused by technical challenges, changing requirements, resource limitations, or external dependencies. 

### **<br/>Different types of software risk.**
  - Project Risks
  - Technical Risks
  - Business Risks
  - Known Risks.
  - Predictable Risks
  - Unpredictable Risks

### **<br/>Define Project risk.**
Project risk refers to any potential event or condition that could hurt the successful completion of a project. These events or conditions can disrupt the project's schedule, budget, quality, or overall objectives.<br/>
Project risks can arise from various sources, including:<br/>
  - Project complexity
  - Size
  - The degree of structural uncertainty 

### **<br/>What are the technical risks?**
Technical risk is a type of project risk that arises from the technical aspects of a project. It refers to the potential for problems or challenges related to the technology, tools, or processes being used.<br/>
Some common examples of technical risks include:<br/>
  - Software bugs
  - Hardware failures
  - Compatibility issues
  - Technological limitations
  - Data quality issues
  - Cybersecurity threats

### **<br/>What are the Business risks?**
Business risk refers to any potential event or condition that could hurt a company's financial performance, reputation, or ability to achieve its strategic objectives. <br/>
The top five business risks are:<br/>
  - Building an excellent product or system that no one wants (market risk)
  - Building a product that no longer fits into the overall business strategy for the company (strategic risk)
  - Building a product that the sales force doesn't understand how to sell.
  - Losing the support of senior management due to a change in focus or a change in people (management risk)
  - Losing budgetary or personnel commitment (budget risks)


### **<br/>Known Risk**
Known risks are those that can be uncovered after careful evaluation of the project plan, and the business and technical environment in which the project is being developed.<br/>
  - unrealistic delivery date
  - lack of documented requirements or software scope
  - poor development environment
