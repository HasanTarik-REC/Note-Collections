### Chapter 6 (Software Testing)

### **<br/>Write the software testing principles.**
  - All tests should be traceable to customer requirements.
  - Tests should be planned long before testing begins.
  - The Pareto principle applies to software testing.
  - Testing should begin “in the small” and progress toward testing “in the large.”
  - Exhaustive testing is not possible.
  - To be most effective, testing should be conducted by an independent third party.

### **<br/>What does mean by software testability?<br/>Briefly explain its characteristics.**
`Software Testability: `<br/> 
S/w testability is simply how easily a system, program or product can be tested. Testing must exhibit a set of characteristics that achieve the goal of finding errors with a minimum of effort.<br/>
**`Characteristics of Software testability?`**
  - Operability  - “The better it works, the more efficiently it can be tested”.
      - Relatively few bugs will block the execution of tests.
      - Allowing testing to progress without fits and starts.
  - Observability -  "Observability refers to how easily a tester can observe the behavior, outputs, and internal states of the software during execution. High observability means that the tester can see clearly if the software behaves as expected under various conditions.“
      - Distinct output is generated for each input.
      - System states and variables are visible or queriable during execution.
      - Incorrect output is easily identified.
      - Internal errors are automatically detected & reported.
      - Source code is accessible.
