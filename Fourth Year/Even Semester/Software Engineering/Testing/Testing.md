### Chapter 6 (Software Testing)

### **<br/>Write the software testing principles.**
  - All tests should be traceable to customer requirements.
  - Tests should be planned long before testing begins.
  - The Pareto principle applies to software testing.
  - Testing should begin “in the small” and progress toward testing “in the large.”
  - Exhaustive testing is not possible.
  - To be most effective, testing should be conducted by an independent third party.
