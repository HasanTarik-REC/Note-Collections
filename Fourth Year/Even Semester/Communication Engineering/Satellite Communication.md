### Chapter 7 (Satellite Communication)

### **<br/>What is satellite communication?**
Satellite communication is a technology that uses artificial satellites to relay and amplify radio telecommunication signals. 
These satellites orbit the Earth and create communication channels between different locations on the planet.<br/><br/>

### **<br/>What do you know about satellite orbits?**
Satellite orbits are the paths that artificial satellites follow around the Earth.<br/>
The type of orbit determines a satellite's altitude, speed, and coverage area, which in turn influences its specific applications.<br/><br/>
Some of the most common types of satellite orbits: <br/>
  - Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
  - Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
  - Geostationary Orbit (GEO)
  - Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO)
  - High Earth Orbit (HEO)
  - Polar Orbit

### **<be/>Describe about GEO satellite.**
A Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite is a type of satellite that orbits the Earth at an altitude of approximately 35,786 km (22,236 miles) above the equator. GEO satellites are positioned in such a way that they appear stationary relative to a fixed point on Earth’s surface, which allows them to provide continuous coverage over specific regions. This stable positioning makes GEO satellites particularly valuable for applications that require constant communication with a fixed area.<br/><br/>
#### `Applications:`<br/>
GEO satellites are widely used for various applications, including:<br/>
  - Telecommunications: They facilitate long-distance communication, including television broadcasting, telephone networks, and internet connectivity.
  - Weather Monitoring: They provide continuous monitoring of weather patterns and conditions, helping in forecasting and disaster management.
  - Navigation: They contribute to global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) like GPS, allowing for accurate positioning and timing.
  - Military and Security: They are used for military communications, surveillance, and intelligence gathering.
<br/><br/>

#### `Advantages:`<br/>
  - They provide constant coverage of a specific region.
  - They enable stable and reliable communication channels.
  - They are well-suited for broadcasting services due to their fixed position.


#### `Disadvantages:`<br/>
  - Launching satellites into GEO orbit is expensive.
  - They can only cover a specific region of the Earth.
  - Due to the long distance, there can be a slight delay in signal transmission.

### **<br/>Which type of orbit does a GEO satellite have? Verify your answer.**
A Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite has a circular orbit located directly above Earth’s equator at an altitude of approximately 35,786 kilometers (22,236 miles). This specific orbit allows the satellite to match Earth's rotation, completing one orbit every 24 hours.<br/>

### **<br/>What is VSAT? (Very Small Aperture Terminal)**
A VSAT is a small satellite dish antenna that can transmit and receive data, voice, and video signals over a satellite communication network. It's designed to be easily installed and operated in remote locations where traditional terrestrial networks are not feasible or cost-effective.<br/>


### **<br/>How does VSAT work? Explain**
The user's device (like a computer or a phone) sends data to the VSAT terminal.
The VSAT terminal, equipped with a small satellite dish antenna, receives the data.<br/>
The VSAT terminal transmits the data signal to a geostationary satellite orbiting the Earth.   
The signal is modulated and amplified for transmission over long distances.<br/>
The satellite receives the signal and demodulates it.
The satellite processes the signal and routes it to the appropriate destination.<br/>
 The satellite retransmits the processed signal back to Earth.
The signal is directed to the intended VSAT terminal or hub.<br/>
The receiving VSAT terminal receives the signal and demodulates it.
The demodulated data is then sent to the user's device.<br/>
 


### **<br/>What are the characteristics of VSAT?**
  - Small size antenna.
  - Relies on geostationary satellites to transmit and receive signals.
  - Support high-speed data transmission.
  - It offers high availability and redundancy, ensuring reliable communication.
  - Can be customized to meet specific needs.

### **<br/>What do you mean by active and passive satellite?**
Active satellite is a type of satellite that is equipped with electronic devices that allow it to receive, amplify, and retransmit signals. It receives signals from Earth stations, amplify them, and then retransmit them to Earth.<br/>

`Applications:` Telecommunications, weather forecasting, GPS navigation, etc.<br/><br/>

Passive satellite is a type of satellite that does not have its own power source or electronic components. It simply reflects radio waves to Earth without amplifying or retransmitting them. <br/>
`Applications:` Early satellite communication systems, radar systems, and some experimental applications.<br/>

### **<br/>State some applications for each type of satellite.**<br/>
#### `Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites`
  - Providing high-speed internet access, especially in rural areas.
  - Monitoring environmental changes, natural disasters, and climate patterns.
  - Conducting experiments in space, such as studying the Earth's atmosphere and climate.
  - Surveillance, reconnaissance, and communication.<br/>
#### `Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) Satellites`
  - Providing precise location information(GPS).
  - Broadcasting radio signals to a wide area.
  - Enhancing cellular network coverage in remote areas.<br/>
#### `Geostationary Satellites (GEO)`
  - Distributing TV signals to a wide area.
  - Monitoring weather patterns and predicting storms.
  - Relaying telephone, internet, and data signals.
  - GPS systems and other navigation services.


### **<br/>What is MEO satellite?  Describe it with the example of GPS.**
Medium-Earth-orbit satellites are positioned between the two Van Allen belts.
A satellite in this orbit takes approximately 6 to 8 hours to circle the Earth.<br/><br/>
One example of a MEO satellite system is the Global Positioning  System (GPS), contracted and operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, orbiting at an altitude of about 18000 km(11,000 mi) above the Earth. The system consists of 24 satellites and is used for land, sea, and air navigation to provide time and location for vehicles and ships. GPS uses 24 satellites in six orbits. The orbits and the locations of the satellites in each orbit are designed in such a way that, at any time, four satellites are visible from any point on Earth.<br/>


### **<br/>What is LEO satellite?**
A Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite is a satellite that orbits the Earth at an altitude of about 500 to 2,000 kilometers. This is the closest orbit to Earth.<br/>

#### `Applications of LEO Satellites:`<br/>
  - To monitor the Earth's environment, weather patterns, and natural disasters.
  - To provide high-speed internet access to remote areas.
  - For surveillance, reconnaissance, and communication in Military and intelligence.<br/>
  
#### `Advantage:`<br/>
  - Ability to capture high-resolution images.
  - Less delay between the transmission and reception of data(Low latency).
  - Launch and operations costs are lower.<br/>
  
#### `Disadvantage:`<br/>
  - Can only cover a small portion of the Earth.
   

### **<br/>What do you know about the frequency bands for satellite communication?**
The frequencies reserved for satellite microwave communication are in the gigahertz (GHz) range. Each satellite sends and receives over to different bands. Transmission from the Earth to the satellite is called the uplink. Transmission from the satellite to the Earth is called the downlink. The band names and frequencies for each range is mentioned below:
| Band | Downlink GHz | Uplink GHz | Bandwidth/MHz |
|---|---|---|---|
| L | 1.5 | 1.6 | 15 |
| S | 1.9 | 2.2 | 70 |
| C | 4.0 | 6.0 | 500 |
| Ku | 11.0 | 14.0 | 500 |
| Ka | 20.0 | 30.0 | 3500 |

 
### **<br/> What is a period of a satellite?**
The period of a satellite is the time it takes for the satellite to complete one full orbit around the Earth and return to its original position. The period depends on the altitude of the satellite’s orbit: satellites closer to Earth have shorter orbital periods, while those further away take longer.<br/><br/>
`Low Earth Orbit (LEO):` Satellites at around 200–2,000 km altitude typically have periods of about 90 to 120 minutes.<br/>
`Medium Earth Orbit (MEO):` Satellites at 2,000–20,000 km altitude generally have periods ranging from 2 to 12 hours.<br/>
`Geostationary Orbit (GEO):` Satellites at approximately 35,786 km altitude have a period of exactly 24 hours, matching Earth’s rotation.<br/>
