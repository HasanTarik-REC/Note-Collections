These satellites orbit the Earth and create communication channels between different locations on the planet.<br/><br/>

### **<br/>What do you know about satellite orbits?**
Satellite orbits are the paths that artificial satellites follow around the Earth.<br/>
The type of orbit determines a satellite's altitude, speed, and coverage area, which in turn influences its specific applications.<br/><br/>
Some of the most common types of satellite orbits: <br/>
  - Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
  - Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
  - Geostationary Orbit (GEO)
  - Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO)
  - High Earth Orbit (HEO)
  - Polar Orbit
