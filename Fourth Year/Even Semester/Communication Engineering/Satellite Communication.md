### Chapter 7 (Satellite Communication)

### **<br/>What is satellite communication?**
Satellite communication is a technology that uses artificial satellites to relay and amplify radio telecommunication signals. 
These satellites orbit the Earth and create communication channels between different locations on the planet.<br/><br/>

### **<br/>What do you know about satellite orbits?**
Satellite orbits are the paths that artificial satellites follow around the Earth.<br/>
The type of orbit determines a satellite's altitude, speed, and coverage area, which in turn influences its specific applications.<br/><br/>
Some of the most common types of satellite orbits: <br/>
  - Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
  - Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
  - Geostationary Orbit (GEO)
  - Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO)
  - High Earth Orbit (HEO)
  - Polar Orbit

### **<be/>Describe about GEO satellite.**
A Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite is a type of satellite that orbits the Earth at an altitude of approximately 35,786 km (22,236 miles) above the equator. GEO satellites are positioned in such a way that they appear stationary relative to a fixed point on Earth’s surface, which allows them to provide continuous coverage over specific regions. This stable positioning makes GEO satellites particularly valuable for applications that require constant communication with a fixed area.<br/><br/>
#### `Applications:`<br/>
GEO satellites are widely used for various applications, including:<br/>
  - Telecommunications: They facilitate long-distance communication, including television broadcasting, telephone networks, and internet connectivity.
  - Weather Monitoring: They provide continuous monitoring of weather patterns and conditions, helping in forecasting and disaster management.
  - Navigation: They contribute to global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) like GPS, allowing for accurate positioning and timing.
  - Military and Security: They are used for military communications, surveillance, and intelligence gathering.
<br/><br/>

#### `Advantages:`<br/>
  - They provide constant coverage of a specific region.
  - They enable stable and reliable communication channels.
  - They are well-suited for broadcasting services due to their fixed position.


#### `Disadvantages:`<br/>
  - Launching satellites into GEO orbit is expensive.
  - They can only cover a specific region of the Earth.
  - Due to the long distance, there can be a slight delay in signal transmission.

### **<br/>What is VSAT? (Very Small Aperture Terminal)**
A VSAT is a small satellite dish antenna that can transmit and receive data, voice, and video signals over a satellite communication network. It's designed to be easily installed and operated in remote locations where traditional terrestrial networks are not feasible or cost-effective.<br/>


### **<br/>How does VSAT work? Explain**
The user's device (like a computer or a phone) sends data to the VSAT terminal.
The VSAT terminal, equipped with a small satellite dish antenna, receives the data.<br/>
The VSAT terminal transmits the data signal to a geostationary satellite orbiting the Earth.   
The signal is modulated and amplified for transmission over long distances.<br/>
The satellite receives the signal and demodulates it.
The satellite processes the signal and routes it to the appropriate destination.<br/>
 The satellite retransmits the processed signal back to Earth.
The signal is directed to the intended VSAT terminal or hub.<br/>
The receiving VSAT terminal receives the signal and demodulates it.
The demodulated data is then sent to the user's device.<br/>
 


### **<br/>What are the characteristics of VSAT?**
  - Small size antenna.
  - Relies on geostationary satellites to transmit and receive signals.
  - Support high-speed data transmission.
  - It offers high availability and redundancy, ensuring reliable communication.
  - Can be customized to meet specific needs.
