### Chapter  (Fiber Optic Communication)

### **<br/>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using optical fiber for data communication?**
#### `Advantages:`<br/>
  - Provides high-speed bandwidth and data rates.
  - Ensures reliable data transmission over long distances.
  - Thin and lightweight.
  - Resistant to corrosion, moisture, and temperature fluctuations.
  - Immune to electromagnetic interference.
  - Greater immunity to tapping.
  - Makes it more secure for transmitting sensitive data.

#### `Disadvantages:`<br/>
  - More expensive than copper cable.
  - Installation and repair of optical fiber cables require specialized skills, equipment, and care.
  - Uses unidirectional light propagation.
  - Fragile and can be damaged by physical stress.

### **<br/>Write short notes on twisted pair cable.**
A twisted pair cable consists of two insulated copper wires twisted together. This twisting helps to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk, which is the interference between signal pairs.<br/>
