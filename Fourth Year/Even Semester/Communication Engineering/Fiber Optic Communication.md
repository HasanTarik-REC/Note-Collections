### Chapter  (Fiber Optic Communication)

### **<br/>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using optical fiber for data communication?**
#### `Advantages:`<br/>
  - Provides high-speed bandwidth and data rates.
  - Ensures reliable data transmission over long distances.
  - Thin and lightweight.
  - Resistant to corrosion, moisture, and temperature fluctuations.
  - Immune to electromagnetic interference.
  - Greater immunity to tapping.
  - Makes it more secure for transmitting sensitive data.

#### `Disadvantages:`<br/>
  - More expensive than copper cable.
  - Installation and repair of optical fiber cables require specialized skills, equipment, and care.
  - Uses unidirectional light propagation.
  - Fragile and can be damaged by physical stress.

### **<br/>Write short notes on twisted pair cable.**
A twisted pair cable consists of two insulated copper wires twisted together. This twisting helps to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk, which is the interference between signal pairs.<br/>


### **<br/>What is meant by data communication?**
The term telecommunication means communication at a distance. The word data refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data. Data communications are the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable. 

### **<br/>Basic Components of a Data Communication System.**
`Message:`
The information or data to be transmitted. It can be text, audio, video, or any other digital format.<br/>
`Sender:`
The sender encodes the message into a suitable format for transmission.<br/>
`Transmitter:`
The device that converts the message into a signal suitable for transmission over the communication medium.<br/>
`Transmission Medium:`
The physical path through which the signal travels from the sender to the receiver.<br/>
`Receiver:`
The device that receives the transmitted signal.<br/>
`Receiver Device:`
The device that processes the received message and presents it to the user. It could be a computer, smartphone, or any other device.<br/>
`Protocol:`
A set of rules that govern communication between devices. It ensures that both the sender and receiver understand the format, timing, and error-checking mechanisms used in the communication process.<br/>
