### Chapter  (Fiber Optic Communication)

### **<br/>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using optical fiber for data communication?**
#### `Advantages:`<br/>
  - Provides high-speed bandwidth and data rates.
  - Ensures reliable data transmission over long distances.
  - Thin and lightweight.
  - Resistant to corrosion, moisture, and temperature fluctuations.
  - Immune to electromagnetic interference.
  - Greater immunity to tapping.
  - Makes it more secure for transmitting sensitive data.

#### `Disadvantages:`<br/>
  - More expensive than copper cable.
  - Installation and repair of optical fiber cables require specialized skills, equipment, and care.
  - Uses unidirectional light propagation.
  - Fragile and can be damaged by physical stress.

### **<br/>Write short notes on twisted pair cable.**
A twisted pair cable consists of two insulated copper wires twisted together. This twisting helps to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk, which is the interference between signal pairs.<br/>


### **<br/>What is meant by data communication?**
The term telecommunication means communication at a distance. The word data refers to information presented in whatever form is agreed upon by the parties creating and using the data. Data communications are the exchange of data between two devices via some form of transmission medium such as a wire cable.
