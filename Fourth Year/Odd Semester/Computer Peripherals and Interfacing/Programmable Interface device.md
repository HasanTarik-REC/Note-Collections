### Chapter 2 (System Development Life Cycle)

### **<br/>What is the system development life cycle?**

The system development life cycle referred to as the application development life cycle is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.

### **<br/>How does (SDLC) relate to system analysis?**

A system development life cycle is a very important process in the system analysis. It describes a system analyst, and how to plan and analyze a system. After analyzing a system, a system analyst needs to design and implement it. That is also in the system development life cycle. The system development life cycle also tells how to maintain a system. So it is directly related to system analysis.


### **<br//>Write down the steps of the system development life cycle and discuss them briefly**

#### `Planning:`

#### `Analysis:`

#### `Design:`

#### `Implementation:`

#### `Maintenance:`


### **<br/>Give insight into the contents of a formal system proposal**

- `Statement of the problem:` A carefully worded statement of the problem that led to analysis.
- `Summary of Findings:` A list of major findings and recommendations should be provided.
- `Details of findings:` An outline of the methods and procedures undertaken by the existing system, followed by coverage of the objectives and procedures.
- `Recommendations and conclusions:` Specific recommendations, regarding the candidate system including personnel assignments, costs, project schedules, and target dates.

### **<br/>Why a system proposal is so important for system design?**

Depending on the result of the initial investigation, a survey is expanded to more details. We need to know,
- What are the user's demonstrable needs and how does a candidate system meet them?
- What resources are available for the given candidate system?
- What is the likely impact of the candidate system on the organization?

### **<br/>What do you mean by candidate system?**

Depending on the user's request system analyst needs to initial investigation. After the initial investigation, a system analyst or system analyst team builds a demo system. Different system analysts can form different demo systems. According to which system analyst should go forward. Those systems are called candidate systems.

### **<br/>What are the considerations that act as important factors in deciding a candidate system?**

#### `Considerations for candidate system:`
  - Operations of existing systems.
  - Maintenance that focuses on "patching" programs.
  - Enhancements that involve major modifications in program structure.
  - Requests for candidate systems.
#### `On the human side, the computer department has to provide the following:`
  - Computer operators to run the equipment.
  - Data entry personnel.
  - Systems analysts to define and design specifications.
  - Application programmers to convert system specifications to computer programs.
  - Maintenance programs to repair errors.
  - Supervisors, project leaders, and managers to coordinate the jobs with the users.


### **<br/>To what extent and how quickly a user-originated idea is converted to a feasibility study depends on which factors?**

The factors are given below
- The risks and potential returns.
- Management bias toward the user.
- Financial costs, and the funds available for system work.
- Priorities of other projects in the firm.
- The persuasive ability of the user.

### **<br/>What internal and external factors influence the system change?**

#### `Internal Factors:`
  - Organization
  - Top management
  - User
  - System Analyst
#### `External Factors:`
  - Government Rules & Regulations
  - Consumers
  - Union
  - Competition

### **<br/>Protyping**
An alternative to this "paralysis by analysis" is an advanced technique called prototyping. Prototyping recognizes problems of cognitive style and uses advanced computer technology. It advocates building a simple system through trial and error and refining it through an iterative process.<br/>
<br/>The basic steps are-
  - Identify the user's information and operating requirements.
  - Develop a working prototype that focuses on only the most important functions, using a basic database.
  - Allow the user to use the prototype, discuss requested changes, and implement the most important changes.
  - Repeat the next version of the prototype with further changes. In corporate until the system fully meets user requirements.
