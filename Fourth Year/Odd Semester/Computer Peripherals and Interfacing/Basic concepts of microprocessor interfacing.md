### Chapter 1 (Basic concepts of microprocessor interfacing))

### **<br/>What is meant by computer peripheral interfacing? Explain with an example.**

##### `Computer Peripherals:`
Computer Peripherals are the components or devices that are connected to the processor and extend the work of the processor. All input and output devices are known as computer peripherals. For this reason, computer peripherals are sometimes called I/O devices.<br/>
In other words, Computer peripherals are the hardware connected to the computer's CPU.<br/>
##### `Interface:`
An interface is the concept of communication between two components, objects, elements, or two parts of a single object or component and it may occur on both hardware and software levels.<br/>
Simplifying, the interface is the interaction between two things.<br/>
#### `Computer Peripherals and Interfacing:`
Computer Peripheral Interfacing is the interaction between computer processors and computer peripherals. Any input or output process that
occurs through a peripheral device is computer peripheral interfacing.<br/>

##### `Components of Computer Peripheral Interfacing:`
To interface among peripheral devices three components are needed.
  - `I/O Processor:` I/O processor is the processor of the computer which means CPU. To interface between peripherals, there must be a central device that will control the interface.
  - I/O Module: While computer peripheral interfacing there must be a mediator between peripherals and processors. Which is normally known as the I/O module.
  - I/O Device: I/O device is the peripheral device with which the interface will occur. This can be any input or output device.
