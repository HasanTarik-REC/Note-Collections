### Chapter 1 (Basic concepts of microprocessor interfacing))

### **<br/>What is meant by computer peripheral interfacing? Explain with example.**

Computer Peripherals are the components or devices that are connected to the processor and extend the work of the processor. All input and output devices are known as computer peripherals. For this reason, computer peripherals are sometimes called I/O devices.<br/>
In other words, Computer peripherals are the hardware that is connected to the CPU of the computer.<br/>
