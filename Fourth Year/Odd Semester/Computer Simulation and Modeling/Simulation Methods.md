### **<be/>Why simulation is required?**
  - Simulation simplifies complex systems for easier analysis.
  - It reduces real-world experimentation costs.
  - It can assess and mitigate risks before making critical decisions.
  - It Predicts future events accurately.
  - It explores rare or extreme scenarios.
  - Simulation produces a data set to estimate the performance of a system.
