### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

### **<br/>What is simulation?**

A simulation is the imitation (নকল করা) of the operation of a real-world process or system over time.<br/>Simulation is a powerful tool that can be used to model real-world processes or systems.<br/>

### **<be/>Why simulation is required?**
  - Simulation simplifies complex systems for easier analysis.
  - It reduces real-world experimentation costs.
  - It can assess and mitigate risks before making critical decisions.
  - It Predicts future events accurately.
  - It explores rare or extreme scenarios.
  - Simulation produces a data set to estimate the performance of a system.


### **<br/>When Simulation is the Appropiate Tool.**
  - Study and experiment with the internal interactions of a complex system.
  - Informational, organizational, and environmental changes can be simulated, and the model’s behavior can be observed.
  - The knowledge gained in designing a simulation model can be valuable in suggesting improvements in the system under investigation.
  - By changing simulation inputs and observing the resulting outputs, valuable insight may be obtained into which variables are most important and how variables interact.
  - Simulation can be a pedagogical (teaching) device to reinforce analytic solution methodologies.
  - It can be used to experiment with new designs or policies before implementation.
  - It can be used to verify analytic solutions.
  - By simulating different capabilities for a machine, requirements can be determined.
  - Simulation models designed for training, allow learning without the cost and disruption of on-the-job instructions.
  - It shows an animation system in simulated operation to visualize the plan.
  - The modern system is so complex that its internal interaction can be treated only by simulation.
