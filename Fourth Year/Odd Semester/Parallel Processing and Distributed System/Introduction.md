### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

### **<br/>What do you mean by parallel processing?**
Parallel processing is a computing technique where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously by dividing a larger task into smaller, independent sub-tasks that can run concurrently. This is achieved by utilizing multiple processors or cores within a system, allowing the work to be distributed and completed more efficiently than sequential processing.
In other words, Parallel computing is the simultaneous use of multiple computing resources to solve a computational problem.

### **<br/>Application of Parallel Processing**
  - High-performance computing
  - Image and video rendering
  - Scientific simulations (e.g., climate modeling, molecular dynamics)
  - Data analytics and machine learning
  - Real-time systems, such as gaming or autonomous vehicles
