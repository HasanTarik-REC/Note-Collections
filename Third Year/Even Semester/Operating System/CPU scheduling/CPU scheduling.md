### Chapter 5 (CPU Scheduling)

### **<br/>Define CPU scheduler.**
A CPU scheduler is a vital part of an operating system that acts as a traffic controller for the central processing unit (CPU).
It decides  the order and prioritizes in which various processes are executed on the CPU.
This is necessary because a CPU can only handle one task at a time. The CPU scheduler aims to make the system efficient, fast, and fair.
