### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

### **<br/>What is Operating System?**

Operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the user and the hardware. It is a resource allocator and provides a platform for the application program.

### **<br/>What are the elements of computer system structure?**
The computer system structure consists of four components. There are-
  - Hardware<br/>
  - Operating System<br/>
  - Application program<br/>
  - User<br/>

### **Goals of Operating System**
 - Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.
 - Make the computer system convenient to use.
 - Efficiently use the computer Hardware.

### **<br/>Functions of an Operating System**
 - Memory management.
 - Process management.
 - Device management.
 - File management.
 - Security.
 - Control over system performance.
 - Job accounting.
 - Error detecting aids.
 - Coordination between other software and user.

   ### **<br/>Define Batch Operating System**
    This type of operating system does not interact with the computer directly. An operator groups similar jobs with the same requirements into batches.<br/><br/>

 ### **<br/>Problems of Batch Operating System**
  - Lack of interaction between the user & the job.
  - CPU is often idle because the speed of I/O is slower than CPU.
  - Difficult to provide the desired priority.

 ### **<br/>Define Multiprogramming**
 Multiprogramming is a fundamental concept in operating systems that allows multiple programs to run simultaneously on a single processor. This technique aims to maximize CPU utilization and increase overall system throughput by overlapping CPU execution with I/O operations. It is also called Non-preemptive.<br/><br/>

 ### **<br/>Define Multitasking/Time sharing**
 Multitasking, also known as time-sharing or multitasking operating system, allows multiple tasks to run concurrently on a single processor. This functionality enables users to run multiple applications simultaneously and switch between them seamlessly.<br/><br/>

### **<br/>Define Multiprocessing operating system**
It is the use of two or more central processing units (CPUs) within a single computer.<br/>It refers to a computer system's ability to support more than one process at the same time.<br/>
