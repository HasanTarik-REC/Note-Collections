### **Chapter 7 (Software Project Management)**

### **<br/>Project management concerns**
Managers concern about the following issues:<br/>
  - Product Quality
  - Risk Assessment
  - Measurement
  - Cost Estimation
  - Project Schedule
  - Customer Communication
  - Staffing
  - Other Resources
  - Project Monitoring

### **<br/>Why Project Fail?**
  - Changing customer requirement
  - Ambiguous/Incomplete requirement
  - Unrealistic deadline
  - An honest underestimate of effort
  - Predictable or unpredictable risks
  - Technical difficulties
  - Miscommunication among project staff

### **<br/>When does a project get into jeopardy?**
  - Software people don’t understand their customer’s needs.
  - The product scope is poorly defined.
  - Changes are managed poorly.
  - The chosen technology changes.
  - Business needs change [or are ill-defined].
  - Deadlines are unrealistic.
  - Users are resistant.
  - Sponsorship is lost [or was never properly obtained].
  - The project team lacks people with appropriate skills.
  - Managers [and practitioners] avoid best practices and lessons learned.



### **<br/>Management Spectrum**
Effective project management focuses on four aspects of the project known as the 4 P’s:<br/>
  - People - The most important element of a successful project. (recruiting, selection, performance management, training, compensation, career development, organization, work design, team/culture development)
  - Product - The software to be built (product objectives, scope, alternative solutions, constraint)
  - Process - The set of framework activities and software engineering tasks to get the job done (framework activities populated with tasks, milestones, work products, and QA points)
  - Project - All work required to make the product a reality. (planning, monitoring, controlling)<br/>
  
### **<br/>People**<br/>**Player of the project**
  - The Stakeholders
  - Team leaders
  - Agile Team (Implementer)
  - Coordination and Communication Issues.<br/>

### **<br/>Stakeholders**
  - Senior managers who define the business issues that often have a significant influence on the project.<br/>
  - Project (technical) managers must plan, motivate, organize, and control the practitioners who do software work.<br/>
  - Practitioners who deliver the technical skills necessary to engineer a product or application.
Customers who specify the requirements for the software to be engineered and other stakeholders who have a peripheral interest in the outcome.<br/>
  - End-users who interact with the software once it is released for production use.<br/>

### **<br/>Team Leaders**
`MOI model for leadership`<br/>
  - Motivation  The ability to encourage (by “push or pull”) technical people to produce to their best ability.<br/>
    - Organization The ability to mold existing processes (or invent new ones) that will enable the initial concept to be translated into a final product.<br/>
    - Ideas or Innovation.  The ability to encourage people to create and feel creative even when they must work within bounds established for a particular software product or application.<br/>
    - Characteristics of effective project managers (problem-solving, managerial identity, achievement, influence, and team building)<br/>

### **<br/>Software Teams**
#### `The following factors must be considered when selecting a software project team structure.`
  - The difficulty of the problem to be solved.
  - The size of the resultant program(s) in lines of code or function points.
  - The time that the team will stay together (team lifetime).
  - The degree to which the problem can be modularized.
  - The required quality and reliability of the system to be built.
  - The rigidity of the delivery date.
  - The degree of sociability (communication) required for the project.

### **<br/>Agile Team**
Small, Highly motivated project team also called Agile Team. It adopts many of the characteristics of successful software projects.<br/>
  - Team members must have trust in one another.
  - The distribution of skills must be appropriate to the problem.
  - Unconventional persons may have to be excluded from the team if team organization  is to be maintained.
  - The team is “self-organizing”
      - An adaptive team structure.
      - Uses elements of organizational paradigm’s random, open, and synchronous paradigms.
      - Significant autonomy.<br/>


### **<br/>What is the W5HH Principle?**
Boehm suggests an approach(W5HH) that addresses project objectives, milestones and schedules, responsibilities, management and technical approaches, and required resources.<br/>
#### `Why is the system being developed?`<br/>
Enables all parties to assess the validity of business reasons for the software work.<br/>
#### `What will be done?`<br/>
Establish the task set that will be required.<br/>
#### `When will it be accomplished?`<br/>
Project schedule to achieve milestones.<br/>
#### `Who is responsible?`<br/>
Role and responsibility of each member.<br/>
#### `Where are they organizationally located?`<br/>
Customers, end users, and other stakeholders also have responsibility.<br/>
#### `How will the job be done technically and managerially?`<br/>
Management and technical strategy must be defined.<br/>
#### `How much of each resource is needed?`<br/>
Develop estimation.<br/>
It is applicable regardless of the size or complexity of the software project.<br/>


### **<br/>Describe the software project management activities.**
Software project management involves a set of activities that ensure the successful planning, execution, and delivery of a software product.<br/> These activities typically include:<br/>
  - `Project Planning:` Project planning is the foundation for the software development process, defining the project's scope, goals, resources, timeline, and budget.
  - `Project Execution:` Project execution involves carrying out the project plan and delivering the software product. This stage focuses on managing teams, coordinating activities, and ensuring timely tasks.
  - `Project Monitoring and Control:` This phase ensures that the project stays on track regarding scope, time, budget, and quality. It involves constant monitoring of the project's progress and implementing corrective actions when necessary.
  - `Risk Management:` Risk management involves identifying potential risks, assessing their impact on the project, and developing mitigation strategies to minimize or avoid them.
  - `Resource Management:` Resource management ensures that the necessary resources (team members, tools, infrastructure) are available and efficiently utilized throughout the project.
  - `Quality Management:` Quality management ensures that the software meets the desired quality standards and customer expectations through planned and systematic activities.
  - `Communication Management:` Communication management ensures that information flows efficiently between project team members, stakeholders, and management. Clear communication is key to project success.
  - `Project Closure:` Project closure ensures that the project is completed successfully, the software is delivered, and all documentation is finalized. This phase includes reviewing project performance, gathering lessons learned, and closing contracts.
