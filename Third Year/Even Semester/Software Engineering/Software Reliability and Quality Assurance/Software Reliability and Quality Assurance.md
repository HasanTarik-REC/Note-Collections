### **<br/>What is software quality?**
Software quality refers to the characteristics of a software product that determine its ability to satisfy the stated needs of its users. In simpler terms, it refers to a software product that meets its intended purpose and user expectations.

### **<br/>Write the software quality management activities.**
Software Quality Management involves the systematic processes and activities that ensure the software product meets specified quality requirements and standards. SQM aims to enhance the software’s reliability, functionality, performance, and overall quality.<br/>
Here are the primary Software Quality Management activities:<br/>
  - `Quality Assurance:` Quality assurance focuses on setting up a systematic process to prevent defects and ensure high standards during software development. It is process-oriented.
  - `Quality Planning:` This is the activity of defining the quality standards and determining how they will be achieved for the software project.
  - `Quality Control:` Quality control focuses on identifying and fixing defects in the software product through inspection and testing. It is product-oriented.
  - `Test Management:` Test management involves planning, executing, and monitoring the testing activities in the project to ensure software quality.
  - `Metrics and Reporting:` Measuring and reporting on the software’s quality attributes, development processes, and testing outcomes is crucial for evaluating quality progress.
  - `Risk Management:` Risk management focuses on identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks that could impact software quality.
  - `Process Improvement:` Continuous process improvement aims to enhance the development and quality management processes for better efficiency and software quality.
  - ``Customer Feedback and Satisfaction:`` Gathering feedback from customers and users helps assess software quality and identify areas for improvement in future releases.

### **<br/>Define Software Quality Assurance.**
Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a systematic approach to ensuring software meets specified requirements and expectations. It encompasses a range of activities aimed at preventing defects and ensuring the quality of the software product throughout its lifecycle.<br/>

### **<br/>Write down the different roles of a SQA group.**
Roles of a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) Group:<br/>
  - Test Planning
      - Define the objectives, scope, and approach of testing.
      - Create detailed test plans and strategies.
      - Identify testing tools, resources, and timelines.
 - Test Design and Development
      - Design test cases and test scripts based on functional and non-functional requirements.
      - Develop automated test scripts and frameworks (if applicable).
      - Identify and prepare test data for different scenarios.
 - Test Execution
     - Execute manual and automated test cases to verify the functionality of the software.  
     - Perform different types of testing such as unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
     - Log defects or issues found during testing and track them until resolution.
 - Process Monitoring and Improvement
     - Monitor the adherence of the development process to predefined standards and guidelines.
     - Conduct audits and reviews to ensure that the processes are being followed.
     - Suggest improvements to the software development process based on test results and quality metrics.
  - Risk Management
      - Identify potential risks related to software quality.
      - Develop risk mitigation strategies to address and minimize those risks.
      - Continuously assess risks throughout the software lifecycle.
  - Quality Metrics and Reporting:
      - Define and monitor quality metrics such as defect density, test coverage, and mean time to failure (MTTF).
      - Generate reports that provide insights into the quality of the software.
      - Present findings and recommendations to the management for decision-making.


### **<br/>Define Software Risk**
Software risk refers to the potential for an undesirable outcome in a software project, which may impact its success in terms of quality, schedule, budget, or performance.<br/> It arises from uncertainties in the development process and can be caused by technical challenges, changing requirements, resource limitations, or external dependencies. 

### **<br/>Different types of software risk.**
  - Project Risks
  - Technical Risks
  - Business Risks
  - Known Risks.
  - Predictable Risks
  - Unpredictable Risks

### **<br/>Define Project risk.**
Project risk refers to any potential event or condition that could hurt the successful completion of a project. These events or conditions can disrupt the project's schedule, budget, quality, or overall objectives.<br/>
Project risks can arise from various sources, including:<br/>
  - Project complexity
  - Size
  - The degree of structural uncertainty 

### **<br/>What are the technical risks?**
Technical risk is a type of project risk that arises from the technical aspects of a project. It refers to the potential for problems or challenges related to the technology, tools, or processes being used.<br/>
Some common examples of technical risks include:<br/>
  - Software bugs
  - Hardware failures
  - Compatibility issues
  - Technological limitations
  - Data quality issues
  - Cybersecurity threats

### **<br/>What are the Business risks?**
Business risk refers to any potential event or condition that could hurt a company's financial performance, reputation, or ability to achieve its strategic objectives. <br/>
The top five business risks are:<br/>
  - Building an excellent product or system that no one wants (market risk)
  - Building a product that no longer fits into the overall business strategy for the company (strategic risk)
  - Building a product that the sales force doesn't understand how to sell.
  - Losing the support of senior management due to a change in focus or a change in people (management risk)
  - Losing budgetary or personnel commitment (budget risks)


### **<br/>Known Risk**
Known risks are those that can be uncovered after careful evaluation of the project plan, and the business and technical environment in which the project is being developed.<br/>
  - unrealistic delivery date
  - lack of documented requirements or software scope
  - poor development environment


### **<br/>Define Predictable risks.**
Predictable risks are generalized from past project experience.<br/>
Example:<br/>
  -  staff turnover
  -  poor communication with the customer, etc.

### **<br/>Define Unpredictable risk.**
Unpredictable risk refers to risks that arise unexpectedly and are difficult or impossible to foresee during the planning stages of a project. <br/>
Example:<br/>
  - Natural disasters
  - Pandemics
  - Political instability
  - Cyberattacks


### **<br/>Define risk identification. Explain how it is done.**

Risk identification is a systematic attempt to specify threats to the project plan (estimates, schedule, resource loading, etc.).<br/>
By identifying known and predictable risks, the project manager takes a first step toward avoiding them when possible and controlling them when necessary.<br/>
Two distinct types of risks<br/>
Generic risks are a potential threat to every software project<br/>
Product-specific risks can be identified only by those with a clear understanding of the technology, the people, and the environment that is specific to the project at hand.<br/>
To identify product-specific risks, the project Plan and the software statement of scope are examined.
One method for identifying risks is to create a risk item checklist.<br/>
The checklist can be used for risk identification and focuses on some subset of known and predictable risks in the following generic subcategories:<br/>
  - Product size —risks associated with the overall size of the software to be built or modified.
  - Business impact —risks associated with constraints imposed by management  or the marketplace.
  - Customer characteristics —risks associated with the sophistication of the customer and the developer's ability to communicate with the customer in a timely manner.
  - Process definition —risks associated with the degree to which the software process has been defined and is followed by the development organization.
  - Development environment —risks associated with the availability and quality of the tools to be used to build the product.
  - Technology to be built —risks associated with the complexity of the system to be built and the "newness" of the technology that is packaged by the system.
  - Staff size and experience —risks associated with the overall technical and project experience of the software engineers who will do the work.
