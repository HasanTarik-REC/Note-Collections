### **<br/>What is flag?<br/>Explain signed overflow and unsigned overflow with example.**
A flag is a bit in a register that indicates the status or outcome of different operations. These flags provide information about conditions like arithmetic overflows, zero results, carry operations, etc.<br/>
Signed and unsigned overflows are Independent phenomena.<br/>
"Signed overflow" occurs when the result of a calculation on a signed number(which can be positive or negative) exceeds the representable range of the data type, causing an incorrect value due to the sign bit being affected.<br/>

"Unsigned overflow" happens when the result of a calculation on unsigned numbers (only positive) exceeds the maximum value that can be stored within the allocated bits, regardless of the sign; essentially, both  situations mean the calculation produced a value too large to fit in the available memory space.<br/><br/>
Example with 8-bit representation:<br/><br/>
`Signed Overflow:`<br/>
	- Consider two positive numbers: +127 and +1.<br/>
	- Binary representation of 127 is 01111111.<br/>
	- Adding 1 results in 10000000, which is -128(due to two's complement representation).<br/>
	- This is considered a signed overflow since adding two positive numbers resulted in a negative value.<br/><br/>
`Unsigned Overflow:`<br/>
	- Adding 200 and 100 results in 300 which can't be represented in 8 bits. So an unsigned overflow occurs.<br/>
	- However, adding 100 and 50 gives 150, within the 8-bit range(0 - 255), so no overflow occurs.<br/>


### **<br/>How flags are affected by signed and unsigned overflow.**<br/>
`Signed Overflow: `<br/>

OF is set: When the result of a signed addition or subtraction operation exceeds the range of the destination operand, an overflow occurs. This means that the sign of the result is incorrect.<br/>
OF is not set: If the result of a signed operation is within the range of the destination operand, there is no overflow.<br/><br/>
`Unsigned Overflow: `<br/>

CF is set: When the result of an unsigned addition or subtraction operation generates a carry or borrow, an overflow occurs. This means that the result has exceeded the maximum unsigned value.<br/>
CF is not set: If the result of an unsigned operation is within the range of the destination operand, there is no overflow.<br/>


### **<br/>Common flags in the 8086 microprocessor**

Carry Flag (CF): Set if the result of an arithmetic operation generates a carry or borrow.<br/>
Overflow Flag (OF): Set if the result of a signed arithmetic operation exceeds the range of the destination operand.<br/>
Zero Flag (ZF): Set if the result of an operation is zero.<br/>
Sign Flag (SF): Set if the result of an operation is negative (the most significant bit is 1).<br/>
Auxiliary Carry Flag (AF): Set if there is a carry or borrow from bit 3 to bit 4 during addition or subtraction.<br/>
Parity Flag (PF): Set if the result of an operation has an even number of 1 bits.<br/>

### **<br/>ADD AX, BX, where AX contains FFFFH, BX contains FFFFH.**
Solution:<br/>
		FFFFH<br/>
		FFFFH<br/>
	            ---------<br/>
	        1  FFFEH<br/>

The result store in AX is FFFEH = 1111 1111 1111 1110<br/>

SF = 1 because the msb is 1.<br/>
PF = 0  because the low byte contains odd number of 1.<br/>
ZF = 0 because the result is nonzero.<br/>
CF = 1 because there is carry out of the msb.<br/>
OF = 0 because the sign of the stored result is the same as that of the numbers being added.<br/>


### **<br/>Read a character. If  it’s  “y”’ or “Y”, display it;  otherwise, terminate the program.**
Solution:<br/><br/>
		MOV  AH,1<br/>
		INT  21H<br/>
		CMP  AL, ‘y’<br/>
		JE  THEN<br/>
		CMP  AL, ‘Y’<br/>
		JE  THEN<br/>
		JMP  ELSE_<br/>  
	THEN:  MOV  AH, 2<br/>
		MOV  DL, AL<br/>
		INT  21H<br/>
		JMP  END_IF<br/>  
	ELSE_:    MOV  AH, 4CH<br/>
		  INT  21H<br/>
	END_IF:<br/>



### **<br/>What is Program Segment Prefix? Explain**

A Program Segment Prefix (PSP) is a data structure used in DOS (Disk Operating System) environments to store information about a program that is currently executing.
When a program is loaded in memory, DOS prefaces it with a 256-byte program segment prefix (PSP). The PSP contains information about the program. 
So that programs may access this area, DOS places its segment number in both DS and ES before executing the program. The result is that DS does not contain the segment number of the data segment.
<br/>To correct this, a program containing a data segment begins with these two instructions:<br/>

MOV AX, @DATA<br/>
MOV DS, AX<br/>

@DATA is the name of the data segment defined by .DATA. The assembler translates the name @DATA into a segment number.<br/>
Our second program will print a sting of characters on monitor.<br/>

### **<br/>Properties of AND, OR, and XOR**

The AND instruction can be used to clear specific destination bits while preserving the others. A 0 mask bit clears the corresponding destination bit; A 1 mask bit preserves the corresponding destination bit.<br/>

The OR instruction can be used to set specific destination bits while preserving the others. A 1 mask bit sets the corresponding destination bit; A 0 mask bit preserves the corresponding destination bit.<br/>

The XOR instruction can be used to complement specific destination bits while preserving the others. A 1 mask bit complements the corresponding destination bit; A 0 mask bit preserves the corresponding destination bit.<br/>


### **<br/>Why do we write the following two statements in the assembly language code?**<br/>
MOV AH, 4CH<br/>
INT 21H<br/><br/>

The two assembly language statements:<br/>
MOV AH, 4CH<br/>
INT 21H<br/>
are commonly used in DOS (Disk Operating System) programs for terminating the program and returning control to the operating system.<br/>
MOV AH, 4Ch sets up the DOS function to terminate the program.<br/>
INT 21h makes the system call, invoking DOS to handle the function (terminate the program in this case).<br/>
This combination is standard for ending a DOS-based program.<br/>



### **<br/>Discuss SAL and SAR instructions of the 8086 microprocessor.**
`SAL: `
The SAL instruction is often used for arithmetic multiplication. However, both SHL and SAL instructions generate the same machine code.<br/>
Negative numbers can also be multiplied by powers of 2 by left shifts.
Suppose AX=FFFFH (-1), CL=03H, then SAL AX, CL gives AX=FFF8H (-8). <br/>

`SAR: `
The SAR instruction operates like SHR, with one difference; the MSB retains its original value (Figure 7.4). The syntax is<br/><br/>

SAR  destination, 1<br/>
and <br/>
SAR  destination, CL<br/>

The effect on flags is the same as for SHR.<br/>

### **<br/>What is meant by masking? Set the most significant and least significant bits of BL register while preserving the other bits.**
Masking in assembly language refers to the process of selectively setting or clearing specific bits within a register or memory location, while leaving the other bits unchanged. 
This is typically achieved using bitwise AND and OR operations with a mask value.<br/>

A mask value is a binary pattern that determines which bits will be affected. 
If a bit in the mask is 1, the corresponding bit in the operand will be preserved. 
If a bit in the mask is 0, the corresponding bit in the operand will be cleared.<br/><br/>
To set the most significant and least significant bits of the BL register while preserving the other bits:<br/>

For an 8-bit register like BL, the most significant bit is bit 7, and the least significant bit is bit 0.<br/>
To set these bits, we need a mask value with 1s in positions 7 and 0, and 0s in the other positions. <br/>
This can be represented as hexadecimal 0x81 (binary 10000001).<br/>

Use the OR operator to combine the mask value with the BL register. This will set the specified bits in BL while leaving the other bits unchanged.<br/><br/>
Here's the assembly code to achieve this:<br/><br/>

mov BL, 0x5A  ; Assuming BL contains 0x5A (binary 01011010)<br/>
mov AL, 0x81  ; Mask value<br/>
or BL, AL     ; Set most significant and least significant bits of BL<br/>

After this code executes, the BL register will contain 0x8A (binary 10001010), with the most significant and least significant bits set, and the other bits preserved.<br/>



### **<br/>Write how many ways we can clear the content of a register**
There are several ways to clear the content of a register in assembly language:<br/><br/>
1. Move the immediate value 0:<br/>

This is the most straightforward method. 
Simply move the immediate value 0 into the desired register.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/>
MOV AX, 0  ; Clears the AX register<br/><br/>
2. XOR the register with itself:<br/>

XORing a register with itself effectively clears its contents. 
This is because any bit XORed with itself results in 0.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/>
XOR BX, BX  ; Clears the BX register<br/><br/>
3. AND the register with 0:<br/>

ANDing a register with 0 clears all bits in the register. 
This is because any bit ANDed with 0 results in 0.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/>
AND CX, 0  ; Clears the CX register<br/><br/>
4. SUBTRACT the register from itself:<br/>

Subtracting a register from itself results in 0. 
This is because any number subtracted from itself is 0.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/>
SUB DX, DX  ; Clears the DX register<br/><br/>
5. Using a specific instruction (if available):<br/>

Some processors have specific instructions to clear registers, such as CLR or ZERO. 
If your processor supports such an instruction, you can use it directly.<br/><br/>
Example:<br/>
CLR SP  ; Clears the stack pointer (assuming the processor supports this instruction)<br/><br/>


### **<br/>Explain why TEST and JCXZ instructions are used in the 8086 microprocessor.**
The TEST and JCXZ instructions are commonly used in 8086 microprocessor programming to perform conditional operations and loop control.<br/>
The TEST instruction performs a bitwise AND operation between two operands but does not store the result. Instead, it updates the flags in the Flags Register based on the result of the AND operation.<br/>
The JCXZ instruction is used to conditionally jump to a different part of the program if the CX register is zero. It is typically used in loop control structures where CX acts as a counter.<br/>
