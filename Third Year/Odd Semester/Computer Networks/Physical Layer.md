### **<br/>Define switching.**
Switching is the practice of directing a signal or data
element toward a particular hardware destination.<br/>

There are two types of switch:<br/>
- Circuit switching
- Packet Switching

### **<br/>Define Circuit switching**

Circuit switching is a method for communication networks where a dedicated path, or circuit, is established between two devices before any data transmission can begin. This dedicated path remains open for the entire duration of the communication session, and no other devices can use it during that time.

### **<br/>Define Packet switching**

Packet switching is a method of data transmission in computer networks where messages are divided into smaller units called packets, which are individually routed and transmitted over the network. Each packet contains control information (source, destination, and its position in the sequence of packets) and a portion of the message data.

### **<br/>Defference between circuit switching and packet switching.**
| Circuit Switching | Packet Switching |
|---|---|
|1.Connection-oriented|1.Connectionless|
|2.Less efficient|2.More efficient|
|3.Less flexible|3.More flexible|
|4.More expensive|4.Often cheaper|
|5.Real-time communication (voice,video)|5.General data transfer (Internet,Email)|
