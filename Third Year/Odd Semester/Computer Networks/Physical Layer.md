### **<br/>Structure of ARPANET**


The subnet would consist of minicomputers called IMPs (Interface Message Processors) connected by 56-kbps transmission lines. For high reliability, each IMP would be connected to at least two other IMPs. The subnet was to be a datagram subnet, so if some lines and IMPs were destroyed, message could be automatically rerouted along alternative paths.


Each node of the network was to consist of an IMP and a host, in the same room, connected by a short wire. A host could send messages of up to 8063 bits to its IMP, which would then break these up into packets of at most 1008 bits and forward them independently toward the destination. 


The software was split into two parts: subnet and host. The subnet software consisted of the IMP  end of the host-IMP connection, the IMJP-IMP protocol, and a source IMP to destination IMP protocol designed to improve reliability. 


### **<br/>Define Internet**
The Internet is a worldwide interconnected network of hundreds of thousands of computers of various types that belong to multiple networks. It use certain common protocols and provide centain common services.
