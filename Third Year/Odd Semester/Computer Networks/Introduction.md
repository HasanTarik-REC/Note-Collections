### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

### **<br/>What is Computer Network?**
Computer network is a Collection of autonomous computers interconnected by a
single technology. Two computers are said to be interconnected if they can exchange information. The connection need not be via a copper wire; fiber optics, microwaves, infrared, and communication satellites can also be used.

### **<br/>Application of Computer Network**
  - Business Application
  - Home Application
  - Mobile Users
  - Social Issues

### **<br/>Can you clarify the mechanism of the client-server model in the context of a computer network?**
If we look at the client-server model in detail, we see that two processes are involved, one on the client machine and one on the server machine. Communication takes the form of the client process sending a message over the network to the server process. The client process then waits for a reply message. When the server process gets the request, it performs the requested work or looks up the requested data and sends back a reply.


### **<br/>Business application of Computer Network**
#### `Primary goal`
- Resource sharing:<br/>
The goal is to make all programs equipment, and especially data available to anyone on the network without regard to the physical location of the resource or the user.
    - Share printer
    - More important than sharing physical resources - sharing data.
    - Share customer records.
 - VPNs(Virtual Private Networks)
 - Client-Server Model
    - web application<br/>
#### `Secondary Goal`
 - Powerful communication medium
      - Email, VOIP, Video calling
 - Desktop Sharing
     - TeamViewer<br/>
#### `Tertiary Goal`<br/>
  - E-commerce(electronic commerce)


### **<br/>Home Application of Computer Network**
- Connectivity:
  - to remote computers.
  - home users can access information, communicate with other people, and buy products and services with e-commerce.
  - people can surf the net for fun, movies, chatting, etc.
  - people can surf the net for news portals.
  - people can surf the net for research like IEEE, Springers, etc.
- Instant messaging.
- Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp.
- E-commerce.

### **<br/>Mobile User Application of Computer Network**
- Connectivity
- Mobile Hotspot
- Texting, sms
- GPS
- M-commerce
- NFC(Near Field Communication)

### **<br/>Classification of computer network by its scale? How?**

| Interprocessor Distance | Processors located in same |  Example | 
|---|---|---|
|    1m  | Square meter | Personal area network |
|   10m | Room | Local area network | 
|  100m |  Building | Local area network | 
|  1km  |  Campus | Local area network | 
|  10km | City | Metropolitan area network |
|  100km  | Country | Wide area network |
|  1000km | Continent | Wide area network |
|  10000km | Planet | The Internet |

### **<br/>Define LAN, MAN, and WAN.**
`LAN:` A Local Area Network(LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus, or office building.

`MAN:` A Metropolitan Area Network(MAN) is a computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area(city).

`WAN:` A Wide Area Network(WAN) is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking.

### **<br/>Design Issues for the layers**
- Reliability
 - uses codes for error detection.
 - error correction
 - They are used at low layers
- Routing
 - Finding a working path through a network.
 - addressing or naming.
 - internetworking.
- Resource allocation
 - who will get priority
 - flow control
 - Quality of service.
- Confidentiality
 - authentication
 - Integrity
