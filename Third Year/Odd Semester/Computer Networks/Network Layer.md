### **<br/>What is an IP Address?**
An IP address is a 32-bit address. The IP addresses are unique.

### **<br/>What is meant by address space?**
Address space generally refers to the range of unique addresses that can be used to identify entities in a particular context.
Such as 
1. Memory address space.
2. IP address space.
3. Port address space, etc.

Address space rule:<br/>

The address space in a protocol That uses N-bits to define an Address is: 2 ^ N.<br/>
Example: addr15, addr1, addr2, addr31, addr41, addr226.<br/>
The address space of IPv4 is 2^32 or 4,294,967,296.

### **<br/>Notation of IPv4 address**
There are two prevalent notations to show an IPv4 address.
1. binary notation: (01110101 10010101 00011101 00000010)
2. Dotted-decimal notation: 117.149.29.2
3. Notation of IPv4 address: A.B.C.D(only 4 octets)
4. 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

### **<br/>Define subnet mask**
To define the network and host portions of an address, a devices use a separate 32-bit pattern called a subnet mask.
