### **<br/>Mapping Cardinalities**

Mapping cardinalities, or cardinality ratios, express the number of entities to which another entity can be associated via a relationship set.

Different types of Mapping Cardinalities:
- One-to-one: An entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B, and an entity in B is associated with at most one entity in A.

- One-to-many: An entity in A is associated with any number of entities in B. An entity in B, however, can be associated with at most one entity in A.

- Many-to-one: An entity in A is associated with at most one entity in B. An entity in B, however, can be associated with any number of entities in A.

- Many-to-many: An entity in A is associated with any number of entities in B, and an entity in B is associated with any number of entities in A.
