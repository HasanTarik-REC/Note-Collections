### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

### **<br/>What is a system?**

A system is an orderly group of independent components linked together to perform pre-defined tasks.


### **<br/>What are the elements of a system?**

The elements of a system are-
- Outputs and inputs
- Processor(s)
- Control
- Feedback
- Environment
- Boundaries and interface

### **<br/>Can you have a viable system without feedback? Explain.**


Yes. We can have a viable system without feedback but it is highly impractical and is not recommended.<br/><br/>
Control in a dynamic system is achieved by feedback. Feedback measures output against a standard in some form of cybernetic procedure that includes communication and control.<br/>
Feedback may be positive or negative, routine or informational. Positive feedback reinforces the performance of the system. It is routine in nature. Negative feedback generally provides the controller with information for action.

### **<br/>Discuss the primary characteristics of the open system. In what way is a system entropic?**

The primary characteristics of an open system:
1. <u>` Input from outside:`</u> Open systems are self-adjusting and self-regulating. When functioning properly, an open system reaches a steady state or equilibrium.
2. <u>` Entropy:`</u> All dynamic systems tend to run down over time, resulting in entropy or loss of energy.
3. <u>` Process, Output, and Cycles:`</u> Open systems produce useful outputs and operate in cycles, following a continuous flow path.
4. <u>` Differentiation:`</u> Open systems have a tendency toward an increasing specialization of functions and a greater differentiation of their components.
5. <u>` Equifinality:`</u> The term implies that goals are achieved through differing courses of action and a variety of paths.
<br/>

 <p>The entropy of an object is a measure of the amount of energy that is unavailable to work. Entropy is also a measure of the number of possible arrangements the atoms in a system can have. A system in which energy can only be transferred in one direction from an ordered state to a disordered state.</p>

### **<br/>What are the differences between physical & abstract system?**

| `Physical System`                                        | `Abstract System`                                                             |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Physical systems are tangible entities.               | 1. Abstract systems are conceptual entities.                                  |
| 2. They can be seen and counted.                         | 2. They can't be seen.                                                        |
| 3. Is a system based only on matter and energy.          | 3. It can be the result of design or invention.                               |
| 4. For example, the physical parts of a computer center. | 4. For example, models the abstract conceptualization of physical situations. |


### **<br/>Difference between open system and closed system.**

The difference between open and closed systems is given below:
| `Open System`                                                                                           | `Closed System`                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Open system is a thermodynamic system where energy and matter can be exchanged with its surroundings. | 1. Closed system is a thermodynamic system where energy can be exchanged with its surroundings but not matter. |
| 2. Can exchange matter with the surrounding.                                                            | 2. Cannot exchange matter with the surrounding.                                                               |
| 3. Mass of the system will vary with time.                                                              | 3. Mass of the system is constant.                                                                            |
| 4. Have boundaries that are not closed.                                                                | 4. Have boundaries that are completely closed.                                                               |


### **<br/>Write down the three basic implications of the system concept.**

The three basic implications:<br/>

1. A system must be designed to achieve a predetermined object.
2. Interrelationships and interdependence must exist among the components.
3. The objectives of the organization as a whole have a higher priority than the objectives of its subsystems.


### **<br/>Briefly describe the characteristics of a system?**

The characteristics of a system are:<br/>
1. `Organization:` It implies structure and order. It is the arrangement of components that helps to achieve objectives.
2. `Interaction:` It refers to the manner in which each component functions with other components of the system. For example, purchasing must interact with production, advertising with sales, and payroll with personnel.
3. `Interdependence:` It means that parts of the organization or computer system depend on one another. They are coordinated and linked together according to a plan.
4. `Integration:` It refers to the holism of systems. Synthesis follows analysis to achieve the central objectives of the organization. Integration is concerned with how a system is tied together.
5. `Central Objective:` The last characteristic of a system is its central objective. It may be real or stated.


### **<br/>Distinguish between a Physical and Abstract system.**

`Physical System:` Physical systems are tangible entities that may be static or dynamic in operation. For example, the physical parts of the computer center are the office desk and chair that facilitate the operation of the computer.

`Abstract System:` Abstract systems are conceptual or nonphysical entities. They may be as straightforward as the formula of relationship among sets of variables or models. The abstract conceptualization of physical situations. A model is a representation of a real or planned system.
