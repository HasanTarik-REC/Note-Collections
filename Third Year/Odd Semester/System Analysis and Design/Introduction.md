### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

### **<br/>What is a system?**

A system is an orderly group of components linked together to perform pre-defined tasks.


### **<br/>What are the elements of a system?**

The elements of a system are-
- Outputs and inputs
- Processor(s)
- Control
- Feedback
- Environment
- Boundaries and interface

### **<br/>Can you have a viable system without feedback? Explain.**

Control in a dynamic system is achieved by feedback. Feedback measures output against a standard in some form of cybernetic procedure that includes communication and control.<br/>
Feedback may be positive or negative, routine or informational. Positive feedback reinforces the performance of the system. It is routine in nature. Negative feedback generally provides the controller with information for action.

### **<br/>What are the differences between physical & abstract system?**

| `Physical System`                                        | `Abstract System`                                                             |

| 1. Physical systems are tangible entities.               | 1. Abstract systems are conceptual entities.                                  |
| 2. They can be seen and counted.                         | 2. They can't be seen.                                                        |
| 3. Is a system based only on matter and energy.          | 3. It can be the result of design or invention.                               |
| 4. For example, the physical parts of a computer center. | 4. For example, models the abstract conceptualization of physical situations. |
