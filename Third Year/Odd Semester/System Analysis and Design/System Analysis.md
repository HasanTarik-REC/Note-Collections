### Chapter 3 (System Analysis)

### **<br/>What is meant by the analyst/user interface?**

Analyst/user interface is an important issue in system design. For various reason such as back-ground, education an user and an analyst doesn't have the same choice. User motivation is out of analyst thought. This fact is known as analyst/user interface.<br/>

### **<br/>Why analyst/user interface is a problem?**

If an analyst cannot understand users problem then it is too hard to solve the problems what users face. So analyst/user interface is a big problem in system analysis.<br/>

### **<br/>What do you mean by initial investigation of a system?**

The initial investigation is the first step in the analysis phase of our project. It is a fact-finding mission in which our aim to find out as mush as we can about our user, the current problem and what the user needs from a computer system in order to solve the problem.<br/>


### **<br/>Why initial investigation is necessary for system analysis?**

The main aim of preliminary analysis is to identify the problem. First, need for the new or the enhanced system is established. Only after the recognition of need, for the proposed system is done then further analysis is possible.<br/>


### **<br/>Why is it difficult to determine user requirements?**

There are several reasons why it is difficult to determine user requirements:
- System requirements change and user requirements must be modified to account for these changes.
- The articulation of requirements is difficult, expert for experienced users.
- Heavy user involvement and motivation are difficult.
- The pattern of interaction between users and analysts in designing information requirements is complex.
