### **<br/>Define Digital signal processing**

Digital signal processing (DSP) is the used to perform a wide variety of signal processing operations.
The signals processed in this manner are a sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous
variable in a domain such as time, space, or frequency.
Example:
1. Speech recognition
2. Audio and music processing
3. Telecommunications
4. Image and video processing


### **<br/>Define signal**

A signal is defined as any physical quantity that varies with time, space, or any other independent variable. 
Example:
1. Audio signal
2. Communication signal
3. Image signal

### **<br/>Define system**

A system may be defined as a physical device that performs an operation on a signal.
Example:
1. Audio system
2. Control system
3. Communication system
4. Image processing system
