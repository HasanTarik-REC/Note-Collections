### Chapter 1 (Introduction)

### **<br/>What do you mean by parallel processing?**
Parallel processing is an efficient form of information processing emphasizing the exploitation of concurrent events in the computing process. Concurrency implies parallelism, simultaneity, and pipelining. Parallel events may occur in multiple resources during the same time interval,  simultaneous events may occur at the same time overlapped periods. These concurrent events are attainable in a computer system at various processing levels. Parallel processing demands concurrent execution of many programs in the computer. It is in contrast to sequential processing.  It is a cost-effective means to improve system performance through concurrent activities in the computer.

### **<br/>Application of Parallel Processing**
  - High-performance computing
  - Image and video rendering
  - Scientific simulations (e.g., climate modeling, molecular dynamics)
  - Data analytics and machine learning
  - Real-time systems, such as gaming or autonomous vehicles
