### Chapter 3 (Cyber Crime)

### **<br/>What is Jurisdiction?**

According to law, "Jurisdiction is the practical authority granted to a formally constituted legal body or to a political leader to deal with and make pronouncements on legal matters and, by implication, to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility."

**There are three main types of judicial jurisdiction.**
1. Personal jurisdiction(personal)
2. Territorial jurisdiction(locum)
3. Subject matter jurisdiction(subjectam)

### **<br/>Digital evidence**
Digital evidence is data stored within electronic devices or systems that can be recovered by forensic experts and used as acceptable evidence in court. Examples: email, text messages, hard drives, social media accounts, audio and video files, smart TVs, etc.

### **<br/>RAM Slack**
The data used for padding is taken from the memory buffers of the system. This data originates from the memory of the computer and is called RAM Slack. RAM Slack pertains only to the last sector of a file. RAM Slack can contain any information that may have been created, viewed, modified, downloaded, or copied during the past work sessions since the computer was last booted. Thus, if the computer has not been shut down for several days, the data stored in the file slack can come from work sessions that occurred in the past. 

### **<br/>File Slack**
When a file is created its length depends upon its contents. When this file is saved to the disk any system using DOS, Windows, or Windows NT saves it in the form of blocks of data. These blocks are of a fixed length and are known as clusters. Most of the time, the contents of files do not exactly match the size of these clusters. The space that remains from the end of the file contents to the last cluster assigned to the file which is called File Slack. To fill in this space randomly selected data from the computer's memory is used. File Slack is created at the time when a file is saved to disk. File Slack is created utilizing randomly selected data from the computer memory.

### **<br/>Drive Slack**
In certain situations, more or additional sectors need to be added to fill out the blocks of the last cluster assigned to a particular file. In such a case, a different kind of slack has to be created.  This is known as Drive Slack. This is then stored in the sectors needed to fill up the last cluster for a file.


### **<br/>Definition of Cybercrime**
E-crimes are almost conventional crimes in nature committed by using computers and ICT with the intention of making social disorder.

### **<br/>What is Cybercrime?**
Cybercrime covers offenses where a computer or other Information and Communication technology are used to commit an offense. The actual offense committed may be a traditional offense.

### **<br/>Black Hat Hacker**
A hacker who gains unauthorized access to computer systems for personal gain. 
The intent of black hat hackers is usually to steal corporate data, violate privacy rights, transfer funds from bank accounts, etc.

### **<br/>White Hat Hacker**
A White Hat hacker who gains access to systems with a view to fixing the identified weaknesses. Then he performs penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

### **<br/>What is Vandalism?**
Vandalism means willful wanton and malicious destruction of the property of others. It is the conspicuous defacement or destruction of a structure,  a symbol, or anything else that goes against the will of the owner / governing body, and usually constitutes a crime.


### **<br/>Cyber vandalism or Web vandalism**
Cyber or Web vandalism is attacks that deface WebPages, or denial-or-service attacks. This usually is swiftly combated and of little harm.

### **<br/>What is Cyber counter-intelligence?**
Cyber counterintelligence is the measures to identify, penetrate, or neutralize foreign operations. It uses cyber means as the primary tradecraft methodology and foreign intelligence service collection efforts that use traditional methods to gauge cyber capabilities and intentions.

### **<br/>Define Hacking**
The process of gaining illegal access to a computer system, or a group of computer systems, is known as hacking. This is accomplished by cracking the passwords and codes that grant access to systems. The hacker is the individual who performs the hacking. By hacking, he gains access to personal data or business data and tries to exploit it.

### **<br/>What are Hacking tools?**
Hackers use the following tools and techniques.
1. Denial of Service attacks
2. Distributed denial of service attacks
3. Ping of death attacks
4. Email bombing
5. Trojans
6. Viruses

### **<br/>Denial of service attacks**
Denial of Service(DoS) is a simple denial of service to others. Here computer workstation or server is unable to provide service to others due to input data overload. The system can not work and the system is crushed. This situation is called Denial of service attacks.<br/>
There are two general methods of DoS attacks: 
1. Crash services
2. flood services. 

### **<br/>Distributed denial of service attacks**
Distributed DoS attacks are interesting and a new phenomenon. Here the perpetrators are many. They are geographically widespread. It is very difficult to control such attacks. The attack is initiated by sending excessive demands to the victim's computer. The victim's servers can not support the excess demands. This makes the server crash.<br/>
Types of DDOS Attacks are:
1. Volumetric Attacks
2. Fragmentation Attacks
3. Application Layer Attacks

### **<br/>Email bombing**
Email bombing is a phenomenon that crashes the servers or overloads the networks by sending huge amounts of junk email. Due to this huge number of junk emails, the network system, and server stop functioning. This phenomenon is termed email bombing.<br/>

### **<br/>What is Virus?**
A computer virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to other programs, self-replicates, and spreads from one computer to another. When a virus infects a computer, it makes copies of itself and attaches to other files or documents. It then modifies those files and continues to spread. Viruses can be very dangerous. 
For example, a virus that stops a computer and displays a message, in the context of a hospital life-support computer 
could be fatal.

### **<br/>Password Fraud**
Password fraud is Fraud that can be committed through many methods, including mail, wire, phone, and the internet, computer crime, and internet fraud by cracking passwords. Fraud, in addition to being a criminal act, is also a type of civil law violation known as a tort. A tort is a civil wrong for which the law provides a remedy.

### **<br/>Data diddling**
Data diddling is extracting and changing the value of data without the knowledge of the owner. Data diddling (also called false data entry) simply means altering data before entering it or entering it into the computer system. This form of cybercrime usually occurs within the organization providing customer services i.e. electricity organization, medical organization, transport organization, etc. where customer bills, personal information, or order of valuable and important records are manipulated.

### **<br/>Salami attacks**
An attack on a computer network involves the intruder siphoning off small amounts of money from a file and placing them in another file that he or she can access. A simple example is when an attacker removes Tk. 0.01 (1 paise) from each account of Bangladesh Bank. No one will notice such a tiny mismatch. But when 1 paise is deducted from all account holders of Bangladesh's largest Bank(Bangladesh Bank), It produces a huge amount.

### **<br/>Cyberstalking**
The Oxford Dictionary defines stalking as "pursuing stealthily". Cyberstalking involves a person's movements across the Internet. The person sends the messages on the bulletin boards frequently to the victim. He can enter the chat rooms and disturb the victim by constantly sending emails.

### **<br/>Trojan horse**
A Trojan horse is a type of malicious code or software that looks legitimate but can take control of your computer. A Trojan is designed to damage, disrupt, steal, or in general inflict some other harmful action on your data or network.

### **<br/>How does Trojan horse differ from viruses**
 Trojan Horses do not replicate themselves.

### **<br/>Worms**
A computer worm is a self-contained program or set of programs that are able to spread functional copies of itself or its segments to other computer systems. This is usually done via network connections. Unlike viruses, worms do not need to attach themselves to a host program. There are two types of worms:
1. Host computer worms
2. Network worms

### **<br/>Packet sniffing**
When any data has to be transmitted over the computer network, it is broken down into smaller units at the sender’s node called data packets and reassembled at the receiver’s node in its original format. It is the smallest unit of communication over a computer network. The act of capturing data packets across the computer network is called packet sniffing.

### **<br/>Keylogging**
Keylogging is the practice of secretly recording input signals from a computer keyboard when the computer user is not aware. It is the equivalent of digital surveillance. It publishes every click and touch, every download and conversation. 

### **<br/>Spyware**
Spyware is a type of malware installed on your device without your knowledge or permission to gather information about you. It keeps an eye on your sensitive information and can do everything from showing pesky advertising and pop-ups on your device all the way to tracking your keystrokes and login credentials. Then it supplies the information to the spyware author or a third party.
