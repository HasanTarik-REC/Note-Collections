### **Cyber Law:**

<p>According to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, “Cyber law is a term used to describe the legal issues related to use of communications technology, particularly cyberspace, i.e. the Internet. It is less a distinct field of law in the way that property or contract are as it is an intersection of many legal fields, including intellectual property, privacy freedom of expression, and jurisdiction. In essence, cyber law is an attempt to integrate the challenges presented by human activity on the Internet with legacy system of laws applicable to the physical world.”</p>
