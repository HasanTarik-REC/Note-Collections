### **<br/>Accuracy**
If the average value of the different measurement is close to the correct value then the measurement is said to be accurate.

### **<br/>Precesion**
If the value of different measurements are close to each other then the measurement is said to be precise.

### **<br/>Absolute Error**
The difference between exact value and measured value is called absolute error.
If X is the true value and X1 is the measured value, then absolute error is EA = |X - X1|

### **<br/>Relative Error**
If EA is the relative error and X is the true value of a quantity the relative error is defined by ER = EA/X.

### **<br/>Percentage Error**
If ER is the relative error then percentage error is defined by EP = ER x 100.

### **<br/>Round off Error**
Round off error is the difference between a rounded off numerical and standard value.

### **<br/>Rounding off Rule**
1. Less than 5, leave the remaining digits unchanged.
2. Greater than 5, add 1 to the last retained digit.
3. Exactly 5 and there are non-zero digits among those discarded, and unity to the last retained digit.

### **<br/>What is numerical method ?**
A numerical method is a mathematical tool designed to solve numerical problems.
Or, Numerical methods are a set of mathematical techniques used to solve problems. They can be used to find approximate solutions to equation, or to optimize designs.

### **<br/>Write the reason to study numerical method.**
1. Finding roots of equation
2. Solving Ordinary Differential equation
3. Finding the value of Integral equation
4. Interpolation and Extrapolation

### **<br/>Inherent Error**
Errors which exist in the problem either due to approximate given data, limitations of computing aids are called inherent errors.
In other word, Inherent error is the error present in source documents.

### **<br/>Exact Number**
Any number which has finite number of digit is called exact number.
Example: 1, 2, 3, 1.758 etc.

### **<br/>Approximate Number**
Which number cannot be expressed by finite digit is called Approximate Number.
Example: 4/3= 1.3333.........
pi = 3.1415.............
root 2 = 1.4142......

### **<br/>Significant digit**
The digit used to express a number are called significant digit.

### **<br/>Write the rules for identifying significant figures with examples**
1. All non-zero digits are significant.
   Example: the value 211.8 has four significant figures.
2. All zeros that are found between non-zero digits are significant.
   Example: 20007 has five significant figure.
3. Leading zeros are not significant.
   Example: 0.0085 has two significant.
4. Trailing zeros to the right of the decimal are significant.
   Example: 92.00 has four significant.

### **<br/>Truncation Error**
Truncation errors are the difference between the actual value of the function and the truncated value of the given function.
Example: The exact value of pi = 3.14192654
The truncated value upto 4 decimal place is 3.1416
Hence, the truncation error is -0.000007364102.

### **<br/>Algebraic Equation**
The equation f(x)=0 is said to be algebraic if f(x) is purely a polynomial in x.
Example: x^3-7x+8=0

### **<br/>Transcendental Equation**
If f(x) cantains trigonometric, logarithmic, Exponential etc then the equation f(x)=0 is called a transcendental Equation.
Example: 3x-cosx-1=0
