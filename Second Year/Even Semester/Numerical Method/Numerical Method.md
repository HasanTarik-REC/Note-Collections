### **<br/>Accuracy**
If the average value of the different measurement is close to the correct value then the measurement is said to be accurate.

### **<br/>Precesion**
If the value of different measurements are close to each other then the measurement is said to be precise.

### **<br/>Absolute Error**
The difference between exact value and measured value is called absolute error.
If X is the true value and X1 is the measured value, then absolute error is EA = |X - X1|

### **<br/>Relative Error**
If EA is the relative error and X is the true value of a quantity the relative error is defined by ER = EA/X.

### **<br/>Percentage Error**
If ER is the relative error then percentage error is defined by EP = ER x 100.
