# Basics of Algorithm<br/>
<br/>

#### **Definition of Algorithm**
<p>Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.<br/>We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-specified computational problem.</p>
