# Basics of Algorithm<br/>
<br/>

### **Definition of Algorithm**
- An algorithm is a finite set of step by step, discrete, unambiguous instructions for solving a particular problem.
- Has input data, and is expected to produce output data.
- Each instruction can be carried out in a finite amount of time in a deterministic way.<br/>

In simple terms, an algorithm is a series of instructions to solve a problem.<br/><br/>

### **Properties of Algorithm**
- #### **Effectiveness**
    - It will be simple.
    - It can be carried out with pen and paper.
- #### **Definiteness**
    - It will be clear.
    - Its meaning will be unique.
- #### **Correctness**
    - It will give the right answer for all possible cases.
- #### **Finiteness**
    - It will stop at a reasonable time.

### **The steps required for algorithm design**
- Pseudo code
- Prove correctness
- Analyze the algorithm
    - Best case efficiency
    - Average case efficiency
    - Worst case efficiency
<br/><br/>

### **What is the need to study Algorithms?**
<p>A computer may be fast, but they are not infinitely fast. And memory may be inexpensive, but it is not free. So, computing time and memory space is a bounded resource. By learning algorithms,  we can use these resources intelligently. And algorithms that are efficient in terms of time or space will help us do this. So we need to study algorithms.</p>
